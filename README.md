# VerificationScript

This script is used to verify the naming conventions in your project. It can check for both Pascal and Camel case naming conventions.

## How to use the script:

### verificationLine.php
- Run the command `php verificationLine.php [your_folder] [option]` in your terminal.
- Replace `[your_folder]` with the path to the folder you want to verify.
- Replace `[option]` with `-noExplain` if you do not want the script to explain how it navigates through folders/subfolders/files.

### verificationPascalOrCamelPersonal.php
- Run the command `php verificationPascalOrCamelPersonal.php [your_folder] [option]` in your terminal.
- Replace `[your_folder]` with the path to the folder you want to verify.
- Replace `[option]` with `-onlyFile` if you only want to show files, or `-onlyDir` if you only want to show directories.

Please ensure that you have PHP installed and configured on your machine to run these scripts.
